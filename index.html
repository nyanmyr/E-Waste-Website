					<h1>E-Waste Problem</h1>
					Every year millions of electrical and electronic devices are
					discarded as products break or become obsolete and are thrown 
					away. These discarded devices are considered e-waste and can 
					become a threat to health and the environment if they are not 
					disposed of and recycled appropriately.
					<br>
					<br>	
					Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing solid
					waste streams in the world. Less than a quarter of e-waste 
					produced globally in 2022 was known to be formally recycled; 
					however, e-waste streams contain valuable and finite resources 
					that can be reused if they are recycled appropriately.
